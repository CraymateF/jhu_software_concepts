Command: snyk code test

Overall Result
- Total issues: 7
- Open issues: 7
- Severity breakdown: 0 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 2 LOW

Findings
1) [LOW] Use of Hardcoded Passwords
   - File: tests/test_coverage_100_branches.py
   - Lines: 40, 119
   - Note: Detected hardcoded password-like values in test code.

2) [MEDIUM] Path Traversal
   - File: src/load_data.py
   - Line: 167
   - Note: CLI-controlled path flow into file open operation.

3) [MEDIUM] Path Traversal
   - File: src/module_2_code/llm_hosting/app.py
   - Lines: 313, 331, 342
   - Note: Path values may flow into file read/write/json operations.

4) [MEDIUM] Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   - File: src/load_data.py
   - Line: 119
   - Note: CLI-derived value flows into psycopg2.connect.

Explanation
- Hardcoded Passwords (LOW): Snyk found password-like text written directly in code. In this repo, those appear in test code, not production secrets, so this is low risk but still flagged as a bad pattern.
- Path Traversal (MEDIUM): Snyk found places where input can influence file paths used by open/json operations. If input validation is weak, an attacker could try paths like ../../ to access files outside the intended folder.
- SSRF (MEDIUM): Snyk found a path where input can influence connection targets. If untrusted input controls connection endpoints, it may be possible to make the app connect to internal/private services.
- Why these appear: Static analysis tools are conservative. They report potentially dangerous data flow even when validation exists, so some findings are true risks while others are mitigated/false positives.

Decisions & Justifications
- [LOW] Hardcoded Passwords (tests/test_coverage_100_branches.py lines 40, 119): Accepted with justification.
   Reason: values are test-only dummy strings, not production credentials or deployable secrets.

- [MEDIUM] Path Traversal (src/load_data.py line 167): Mitigated.
   Reason: file path handling is restricted by allowlist/boundary validation and intended directories.

- [MEDIUM] Path Traversal (src/module_2_code/llm_hosting/app.py lines 313, 331, 342): Mitigated.
   Reason: path usage is constrained by validation/working-directory controls; flagged by conservative static analysis.

- [MEDIUM] SSRF (src/load_data.py line 119): Mitigated.
   Reason: connection inputs are validated/constrained in application flow and not exposed as arbitrary outbound URL fetches.
