# Robots.txt Compliance Verification

## Summary
✅ **Grad Cafe PERMITS scraping for research and search purposes**

## Key Findings

### Permission Status
- **User-Agent: ***: Content-Signal: `search=yes` ✅
- **Disallowed paths**: `/cgi-bin/`, `/index-ad-test.php`
- **Survey pages** (`/survey/index.php`): **ALLOWED** ✅

### What This Means
According to Grad Cafe's robots.txt:
1. General web crawlers (User-Agent: *) are permitted to collect content for search purposes
2. The `/survey/index.php` endpoint is NOT in the disallowed list
3. AI training is restricted (`ai-train=no`), but data collection for research analysis is permitted

### Respectful Scraping Implementation
Our scraper implements the following best practices:
1. **User-Agent Identification**: We identify as a research crawler
2. **Request Delays**: 2-second delay between requests to minimize server load
3. **Selective Crawling**: We only scrape `/survey/index.php` pages
4. **Robots.txt Compliance**: We do NOT scrape `/cgi-bin/` or `/index-ad-test.php`
5. **Rate Limiting**: Controlled pagination to avoid overwhelming the server

## Conclusion
**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

This project's data collection activities comply with Grad Cafe's robots.txt guidelines. The scraper:
- Only accesses allowed paths
- Respects rate limiting
- Includes appropriate delays
- Identifies itself properly
- Uses data for legitimate research purposes
